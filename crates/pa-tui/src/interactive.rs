//! Interactive agent session over the daemon: attach to a live session, send
//! prompts, render streamed assistant output, and switch sessions. This is
//! the interactive product surface of `crates/pa-tui` (the port of the
//! interactive mode's daemon-attach path); the session loop itself keeps
//! running in the daemon worker, so closing the UI detaches instead of
//! stopping the session.
//!
//! Two UI sources drive the same loop: a crossterm terminal (raw mode, alt
//! screen) and a headless plan (programmatic input, captured frames). The
//! headless source is the verifier seam: it exercises the identical
//! attach/submit/stream/render path without a TTY.
